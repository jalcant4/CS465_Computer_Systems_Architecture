# CS465_Computer_Systems_Architecture
A study of assembly programming with MIPS

1. hw1 - There	is	no	built-in	facility	in	MIPS	that	can	convert	a	string	into	an	
integer	as	atoi() function	in	C. We implement	a	program to	extract	the	integer	value	from	a	string	typed	in by	the	user.
2. hw2 - A	program	to	accept	a	32-bit	machine	code	(as	a	
hexadecimal	string)	from	the	user,	decode, and	report	certain	features	of	the	decoded	MIPS	
instruction.	
3. hw3 - A program to accept a sequence of machine
code (as hexadecimal strings) from the user, decode, identify and report true data dependences as
well as stalls triggered by data hazards for a 5-stage pipeline processor with no forwarding.
4. hw4 - A written exercise on virtual memory and addressing.

# Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts in computer architecture. Topics include: basic system components, performance measurements, instructions and their representation, number representation, implementation of arithmetic operations, processor organization, pipelining, and memory hierarchy.

# Course Outcomes:
1. Be able to explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional components
2. Be able to compare performance of simple system configurations and understand the performance implications of architectural choices
3. Be able to show how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler; be able to understand small MIPS programs and write MIPS assembly program segments
4. Be able to use different formats to represent numerical data and convert numerical data from one format to another
5. Be able to explain how an instruction is executed and the concept of datapaths and control
6. Be able to explain basic instruction level parallelism using pipelining and the major hazards that may occur
7. Be able to explain the effect of memory latency on running time; be able to describe the use of memory hierarchy to reduce the effective memory latency, in particular, the role of cache and virtual memory; be able to understand the principles of memory management
