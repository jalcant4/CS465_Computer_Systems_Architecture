# CS465_Computer_Systems_Architecture
A study of assembly programming with MIPS

# Course Outcomes:
1. Be able to explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional components
2. Be able to compare performance of simple system configurations and understand the performance implications of architectural choices
3. Be able to show how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler; be able to understand small MIPS programs and write MIPS assembly program segments
4. Be able to use different formats to represent numerical data and convert numerical data from one format to another
5. Be able to explain how an instruction is executed and the concept of datapaths and control
6. Be able to explain basic instruction level parallelism using pipelining and the major hazards that may occur
7. Be able to explain the effect of memory latency on running time; be able to describe the use of memory hierarchy to reduce the effective memory latency, in particular, the role of cache and virtual memory; be able to understand the principles of memory management
